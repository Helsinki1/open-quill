Every fall, countless international students leave behind their communities, cultures, and loved ones to pursue higher education in the United States, drawn by the promise of opportunity and prestige of American institutions. Yet, behind the glossy brochures and world-class rankings, reality is much different from what they imagine. Despite being physically present in the United States, their visa restrictions, limited access to financial aid, and barriers to permanent employment present substantial challenges to their career development – effectively denying their access to the same opportunities as domestic students. To make matters worse, the conditions of the F-1 student visa – the visa that allows international students to live in the United States during their college enrollment – state that a “non-resident alien” would face deportation if they cannot secure employment after graduation. This means that students hoping to stay in the country after college face immense pressure to find employers willing to sponsor their visas – something employers are reluctant to do. All of these factors naturally raise the question: how should our immigration and education systems change to better serve a global community of scholars? 
	As an international student myself, the most difficult part about studying at an American university is the lack of monetary support. Currently, foreign students have very limited access to need-based financial aid as their applications are reviewed through a need-aware process that factors in their ability to pay. Unlike domestic students who can submit their FAFSA documentation and receive aid for an affordable cost of attendance, most universities do not guarantee fulfillment of international students’ demonstrated need. When I was in the midst of applying to college last year, I would face policies that hurt my application simply based on how much my family struggled to pay tuition. On their official website, Columbia University states that “the admissions committee considers how much financial aid [an international student] requires when evaluating an application”(“International…”). This means that an applicant could be rejected not on the basis of their merit, but because of their socioeconomic status. If prestigious, wealthy institutions in the Ivy League take so much pride in their global reach and impact, then why do they fundamentally discriminate against the global portion of their student body? 
	Equally important as funding my education is my ability to find employment. Yet, we international students face setbacks in this area as well, with additional requirements of school authorization and employer sponsorship. According to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, students on an F-1 visa are only allowed to “work off-campus on a case-by-case basis… [and] employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work”(“Students…”). With the job market becoming increasingly competitive, the last thing that students need is another reason dissuading employers from offering them opportunities. Most companies simply do not want to navigate the complex and expensive H1-B or O-1 visa sponsorship processes. Moreover, even if a student is able to secure an internship or job, they must abide by the tight regulations of work authorization programs, which limit the type of work they can do and restrict the number of hours they can work (“Working…”). This limitation puts us at a distinct disadvantage compared to domestic students. With so many restrictions placed on our ability to find work, it becomes clear that international students are not nearly on the same playing field as other students.
The barriers international students face don’t just affect their financial and job stability, they also hold back their long-term personal and professional growth. These policies enacted by universities and immigration offices hinder foreign students’ ability to fully integrate into the American workforce and society, making it more difficult to form connections, gain relevant experience, and secure stable employment after graduation. Meanwhile, we are charged the same tuition prices and put through the same academic rigor. These burdens of high costs and limited career prospects lie in stark contrast to the values of equality and opportunity that America prides itself on, implications that are fundamentally at odds with this nation’s rich history of immigration.
